# SQLite Checkpointing

`SQLiteCheckpointer` is the lightweight persistence backend: a single
local file, no server, append-only message log. It's the default
choice for laptops, single-process apps, desktop tools, and any
environment where one Python process owns the conversation.

Install the extra:

```bash
pip install "cubepi[sqlite]"
```

This pulls in `aiosqlite`.

## Basic usage

```python
import asyncio
from cubepi import Agent
from cubepi.checkpointer import SQLiteCheckpointer
from cubepi.providers.anthropic import AnthropicProvider


async def main():
    provider = AnthropicProvider(provider_id="anthropic", api_key="…")
    async with SQLiteCheckpointer("agent.db") as cp:
        agent = Agent(
            model=provider.model("claude-sonnet-4-6"),
            checkpointer=cp,
            thread_id="user-42",
        )
        await agent.prompt("Remember: my favourite colour is teal.")

        # Restart the script later — the file persists.
        await agent.prompt("What did I say my favourite colour was?")
        # → "You said teal."


asyncio.run(main())
```

Two things to internalise:

1. **`thread_id`** is your conversation identifier — usually a user id
   or a session id. Two agents on the same `thread_id` share the same
   history.
2. **`async with SQLiteCheckpointer(...)`** is required: the context
   manager opens the connection and runs the one-time table creation
   on `__aenter__`. Using it without the context manager will raise
   `AssertionError`.

## What gets persisted

`SQLiteCheckpointer` writes two tables on first use:

```sql
CREATE TABLE messages (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    thread_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    message_json TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT (julianday('now'))
);

CREATE TABLE thread_extra (
    thread_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    extra_json TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'
);
```

- Every `UserMessage`, `AssistantMessage`, and `ToolResultMessage`
  becomes one row in `messages`. Pydantic `model_dump()` is used for
  the JSON payload.
- The `extra` dict on `AgentContext` is persisted on `agent_end` into
  `thread_extra`. Middleware that wants thread-scoped state should
  write into `context.extra`.

This schema is append-only. CubePi never updates or deletes rows.

## HITL tables

When the [HITL](../hitl/overview) module is in use, additional tables are
created automatically on `__aenter__`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS thread_pending_request (
    thread_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    request_json TEXT NOT NULL,
    run_id TEXT,
    created_at REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT (julianday('now'))
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS thread_hitl_answers (
    thread_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    run_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    question_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    answer_json TEXT NOT NULL,
    answered_at REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT (julianday('now')),
    PRIMARY KEY (thread_id, run_id, question_id)
);
```

`thread_pending_request` stores the single visible HITL request for a
thread. `thread_hitl_answers` stores already-answered prompts so a
parallel approval batch can collect approvals one by one and then
execute the batch only after every gate is satisfied.

No manual migration is needed — `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is
idempotent.

## When CubePi reads

On the **first** `prompt()` after instantiation, CubePi calls
`load(thread_id)`. If the thread exists, history is restored into
`agent.state.messages` and `extra` is restored into the agent's
private `_extra` dict.

Subsequent `prompt()` calls don't re-read — the in-memory state is
authoritative.

This means: **don't share one `Agent` instance across processes**.
Process A's in-memory state will diverge from Process B's writes.

## Multi-thread isolation

```python
async with SQLiteCheckpointer("agent.db") as cp:
    alice = Agent(model=…, checkpointer=cp, thread_id="alice")
    bob   = Agent(model=…, checkpointer=cp, thread_id="bob")
    # Each call only loads/appends its own thread.
```

You can pool one checkpointer across many users; the `thread_id`
isolates them.

## Concurrency model

The checkpointer uses an `asyncio.Lock` around every read and write.
SQLite itself can be written from multiple processes, but CubePi's
expectation is that a single agent instance owns a thread. If you
have multiple processes writing the same `agent.db`:

- Reads are safe.
- Concurrent writes to **different** threads are safe.
- Concurrent writes to the **same** thread will interleave and the
  resulting history won't make sense — you'll see two assistant
  messages back-to-back, etc.

If you need multi-process writers on shared threads, jump to
[Postgres](./postgres) which uses an advisory lock per thread.

## Forks

`SQLiteCheckpointer` implements the v4 `snapshot` / `fork` /
`claim_run` / `mark_run_complete` / `load_pending` Protocol methods,
so it supports both `Agent.fork(...)` and `Agent.fork_once(...)`. See
the [Conversation Forking](../agents/forking) guide for the user-facing API.

## Schema v3 → v4 migration

Unlike Postgres and MySQL, SQLite's schema is managed by CubePi
itself: the v3→v4 upgrade (adding `run_id` to `messages` and
creating a `cubepi_runs` table) runs automatically on `__aenter__`
the first time a v4 CubePi connects to a v3 file. No host action is
required.

Pre-feature messages keep `run_id = NULL` and remain readable; see
[Legacy data behaviour](../agents/forking#legacy-data-behaviour) for the
fork-eligibility rules on mixed threads.

## Where the file lives

Use an absolute path in production:

```python
SQLiteCheckpointer("/var/lib/myapp/agent.db")
```

Relative paths resolve against `os.getcwd()` at the moment of
`__aenter__`. The directory must exist; create it ahead of time.

## Backup and inspection

The file is a normal SQLite database. You can:

```bash
# Inspect history for a thread
sqlite3 agent.db "SELECT message_json FROM messages WHERE thread_id='user-42' ORDER BY id"

# Back up
cp agent.db agent.db.bak

# Vacuum to reclaim space (optional — file grows linearly with history)
sqlite3 agent.db "VACUUM"
```

## Common pitfalls

- **Used without `async with`** — `AssertionError: self._db is not
  None`. Always wrap in `async with`.
- **Two processes writing the same thread** — Interleaved history.
  Use Postgres or coordinate at the application layer.
- **WAL mode not enabled** — CubePi uses the default journal mode for
  portability. For a single-writer, many-reader app, enable WAL once
  via `sqlite3 agent.db "PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL"` for better read
  concurrency.
- **Forgetting to set `thread_id`** — Without it, the agent has no
  persistence binding. The checkpointer is silently ignored. Always
  pass both.
- **`CheckpointCorruptionError` on `load()`** — A persisted message row
  failed to deserialize (bad JSON, schema-invalid data, or an unknown
  role). The error's `row_ref` (e.g. `messages.id=42`) locates the bad
  row so you can inspect or repair it with plain SQL; `thread_id` and
  `__cause__` carry the rest of the context. CubePi never skips corrupt
  rows silently — dropping a message that carries `tool_calls` would
  leave the transcript in a state every provider rejects.
