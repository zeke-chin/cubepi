"""Tail a run file and print spans as a flat chronological event stream.

Spans are written by JsonlSpanExporter when they *end*, and children end
before their parents, so a live tree cannot be drawn correctly. Instead we
print one line per span in the order it completes. The run is considered
finished when the root ``invoke_agent`` span (``parent_id == null``) appears.
